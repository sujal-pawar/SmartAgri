## 🌟 Project Overview

**SmartAgri** is an innovative precision agriculture platform that bridges the gap between advanced satellite technology and practical farming needs. Our solution democratizes access to Earth Observation data for farmers, providing actionable insights to improve crop yields, optimize resource usage, and build climate resilience.

### 🎯 Problem Statement

Indian farmers face significant challenges:
- **Limited access** to advanced agricultural technologies
- **Inefficient resource management** leading to wasted water, fertilizer and pesticides
- **Climate unpredictability** affecting crop planning and yields
- **Information gap** between government agricultural schemes and farmers
- **Financial vulnerability** due to crop failures and market fluctuations

### 💡 Our Solution

SmartAgri transforms satellite data into practical, farm-specific insights delivered through an intuitive dashboard that works on any device. Our platform helps farmers:
- **Make data-driven decisions** about when to irrigate, fertilize, or harvest
- **Detect early signs** of crop stress, disease, and pest infestations
- **Optimize resource usage** to reduce costs and environmental impact
- **Access financial aid** opportunities from government and private sources
- **Build climate resilience** through better planning and risk management

## 🌱 Innovation Highlights

### 1️⃣ Democratizing Satellite Technology
We've simplified complex Earth observation data processing into an intuitive interface accessible to farmers with basic smartphones, bridging the technological divide in rural agriculture.

### 2️⃣ Multi-Index Vegetation Analysis
Unlike systems that rely solely on NDVI, our platform calculates 8+ specialized vegetation indices to provide a comprehensive view of crop health and stress factors:
- **NDVI**: General vegetation health
- **EVI**: Enhanced sensitivity in high-biomass regions
- **NDWI/NDMI**: Water content in vegetation
- **NDRE**: Nitrogen content estimation
- **CRI1**: Carotenoid content for stress detection
- **PSRI**: Plant senescence monitoring
- **GCI**: Chlorophyll content estimation

### 3️⃣ Unified Financial Aid Hub
We've consolidated fragmented information about agricultural subsidies, loans, and government schemes into a personalized recommendation engine that matches farmers with appropriate financial support based on their specific circumstances.

### 4️⃣ Field-Specific Data Processing
Instead of generic regional data, our platform processes satellite imagery for each individual field boundary, providing truly personalized insights at the farm level.

### 5️⃣ Full-Spectrum Agricultural Platform
Rather than focusing on a single aspect, SmartAgri integrates climate analysis, crop management, field mapping, and financial support into a unified platform addressing the full spectrum of farming needs.

## 🔍 Technical Implementation

### Google Earth Engine Integration
```python
# NDVI Calculation Example
def getNDVI(image):
    ndvi = image.normalizedDifference(['B8', 'B4']).rename('ndvi')
    return ndvi.copyProperties(image, ['system:time_start'])

# Map function over image collection
ndvi_series = sentinel2Collection.map(getNDVI)
```

### API Architecture
```javascript
// Field coordinate processing endpoint
app.post('/api/update-manipal', (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { fieldId } = req.body;
    // Transform field coordinates for satellite processing
    const manipalCoordinates = {};
    fieldData.coordinates.forEach((coord, index) => {
      manipalCoordinates[(index + 1).toString()] = [coord.lng, coord.lat];
    });
    // Write coordinates to processing file
    fs.writeFileSync(manipalPath, JSON.stringify(manipalCoordinates, null, 2));
    return res.status(200).json({
      success: true,
      message: 'Coordinates updated successfully',
      coordinates: manipalCoordinates
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error updating coordinates:', error);
    return res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      message: `Error: ${error.message}`
    });
  }
});
```

### Context-based State Management
```jsx
// Custom setter to update both UI and satellite processing coordinates
const handleSetSelectedField = (fieldId) => {
  setSelectedField(fieldId);
  
  // Update processing coordinates when field changes
  if (fieldId) {
    updateManipalCoordinates(fieldId)
      .then(result => {
        if (!result.success) {
          console.warn('Failed to update coordinates:', result.message);
        }
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error updating coordinates:', error);
      });
  }
};
```
